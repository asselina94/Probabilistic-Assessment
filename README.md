Probabilistic Assessment of Dose to Workers due to Radiological Emergency Situation.

Industrial radiography workers commonly use high radioactivity source and carry out the work in poor conditions. Thus, when the event of an unexpected accident occurs, workers are more likely to be exposed to high doses.

In the actual accident case, the variables for calculating dose such as time, distance, shielding are not sure and it has high uncertainty. 

Methodology of this study could not only be applied in accident of radiation worker but also radiological terror for public.
